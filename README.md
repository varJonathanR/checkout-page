## Overview

- What have I learned/improved?

This project provided me with a great opportunity to learn how to effectively utilize ReactJS, its components, and its ability to effectively structure projects into distinct blocks. Although there is always room for further improvement, this has been a significant advancement for me. Furthermore, I have familiarized myself with the process of utilizing and consuming APIs, although there is still more knowledge to be attained in regards to debugging errors and establishing connections between components. I am confident that through continued practice, I will develop even stronger skills.
